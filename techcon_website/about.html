        <p>TechCon began in 2014 as a small community meetup created by passionate developers, designers, and technology enthusiasts who wanted a space to learn, share ideas, and connect. What started with fewer than 50 attendees in a local co-working hub quickly grew into one of the region’s most anticipated annual technology gatherings.</p>
        <p>Over the years, TechCon expanded its focus from basic software discussions to cutting-edge innovations—cloud computing, cybersecurity, AI, blockchain, robotics, data science, and more. Each edition introduced hands-on workshops, expert-led sessions, startup showcases, and networking opportunities aimed at empowering both beginners and industry professionals.</p>
        <p>Today, TechCon Conference 2024 stands as a decade-strong platform that continues to inspire innovation, foster collaboration, and shape the future of technology across Africa and beyond. Each year builds on the same vision that started it all: a community where knowledge is shared, ideas become solutions, and technology drives positive change.</p>
